This wezterm config is organized around the `ALT+key` Among other things it can
run a wezterm `a`ction (command palette), `-` to make a `n`ew `s`plit pane or
`\\` for a `v`ertical , `h←j↓k↑l→` for moving (add `SHIFT` for resizing),
`q`uit, s`w`ap or `z`oom in/out panes.

Inside a pane you can `f`ind text, open visible area in `e`ditor or e`x`ecute a
command in a separate tab.

Workspace related bindings are under `ALT+SHIFT+key`, you can create a new or
select an open workspace, you can open an existing `p`roject/directory on disk
in a new workspace with the same name.
