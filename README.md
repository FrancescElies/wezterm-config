This wezterm config is organized around the `ALT+key` Among other things it can
run a wezterm `a`ction (command palette), `-` to `s`plit current pane or `\\`
for a `v`ertical , - `h j k l` for moving between splits (add `SHIFT` for
resizing instead), `q`uit pane, s`w`ap panes, `z`oom in/out pane

Inside a pane you can `f`ind text, open visible area in `e`ditor, e`x`ecute to
run a command in a separate tab, go to next `t`ab and previous `T`ab.

Workspace related bindings are under `ALT+SHIFT+key`, you can `g`o to a
workspace, open a `p`roject in a new workspace.

`ALT+SHIFT+key` to keep wezterm window on `T`op or keep it at the `B`ottom
