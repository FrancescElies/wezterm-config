# `ALT` centric wezterm config

A wezterm config organized around the `ALT` key

- [f]ind in pane
- wezterm [c]ommand
- [C]opy mode
- typical [hjkl] for moving around (add `SHIFT` resizing instead)
- [s]wap pane
- [-\\] split vertical and horizontal pane
- [r]otate panes clockwise (add `SHIFT` for counter clockwise)
- lazy[g]it in split pane (add `SHIFT` for vertical split)
- [b]root in split pane (add `SHIFT` for vertical split)

Workspace related bindings are under `ALT+SHIFT`:

- fuzzy switch or create new [w]orkspace,
- [n]ext worskpace and [p]revious workspace
- new [s]ession (workspace from existing project)
