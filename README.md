# `ALT` and `hjkl` centric wezterm config

Wezterm gives you a cross-platform terminal and multiplexer with tmux like
capabilities that works on linux, mac and windows.

The config is organized around the `CTRL+SHIFT+key` and `hjkl` to move between
panes tabs and workspaces.

Inside a pane you can `f`ind text, open visible area in `e`ditor or e`x`ecute a
command in a separate tab.
