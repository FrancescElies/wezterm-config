# An `ALT+key` centric wezterm config

Wezterm gives you a cross-platform terminal and multiplexer with tmux like
capabilities that works on linux, mac and windows.

The config is organized around the `ALT+key`.

Inside a pane you can `f`ind text, open visible area in `e`ditor or e`x`ecute a
command in a separate tab.

Run a wezterm `a`ction (command palette), `-` to make a `s`plit pane or `\\`
for a `v`ertical one, `hjkl` for moving ←↓↑→ (add `SHIFT` for resizing),
`q`uit, s`w`ap, `t` for converting a pane into a tab or `z`oom in/out panes.

Workspace bindings are under `ALT+SHIFT+key`, `f`uzzy find an existing folder
into a workspace, go to `d`efault workspace or `s`elect currently open
workspaces.
