# `ALT` and `hjkl` centric wezterm config

Wezterm gives you a cross-platform terminal and multiplexer with tmux like
capabilities that works on linux, mac and windows.

The config is organized around the `ALT+key` and `hjkl` to move between
panes tabs and workspaces.

Inside a pane you can `f`ind text, open visible area in `e`ditor or e`x`ecute a
command in a separate tab.

Run a wezterm `a`ction (command palette), `-` to make a `s`plit pane or `\\`
for a `v`ertical one, `hjkl` for moving ←↓↑→ (add `CTRL` for resizing),
`q`uit, s`w`ap, `t` for converting a pane into a tab or `z`oom in/out panes.

Workspace and tab bindings are under `ALT+SHIFT+key`, `p` to open a
project/folder into a workspace,`o` to open one of your workspaces, `hl`
to switch between tabs, `hl` cycles through tabs in workspace, `jk`
cycles through current workspaces.
